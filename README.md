# Stream Mining

Utilization of machine learning algorithms with the focus on estimating the unbounded data stream.

## Repository structure

* `./sketches`: Sketches estimating the stream data
* `./time-series`: Time-series analysis including *Anomaly* and *Change Detection*

## Sketches

* Bloom Filter (BF)
* Count-Min Sketch (CMS)
* Flajolet-Martin (FM)
